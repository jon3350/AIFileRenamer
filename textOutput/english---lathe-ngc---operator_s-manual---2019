Covering Haas Automation, Inc. CNC Equipment
Effective September 1, 2010
Haas Automation Inc. (“Haas” or “Manufacturer”) provides a limited warranty on all new
mills, 
turning 
centers, 
and 
rotary 
machines 
(collectively, 
“CNC 
Machines”) 
and 
their
components 
(except 
those 
listed 
below 
under 
Limits 
and 
Exclusions 
of 
Warranty)
(“Components”) that are manufactured by Haas and sold by Haas or its authorized
distributors as set forth in this Certificate. The warranty set forth in this Certificate is a
limited warranty, it is the only warranty by Manufacturer, and is subject to the terms and
conditions of this Certificate.
Limited Warranty Coverage
Each CNC Machine and its Components (collectively, “Haas Products”) are warranted by
Manufacturer against defects in material and workmanship. This warranty is provided only
to an end-user of the CNC Machine (a “Customer”). The period of this limited warranty is
one (1) year. The warranty period commences on the date the CNC Machine is installed at
the Customer’s facility. Customer may purchase an extension of the warranty period from
an authorized Haas distributor (a “Warranty Extension”), any time during the first year of
ownership.
Repair or Replacement Only
Manufacturer’s sole liability, and Customer’s exclusive remedy under this warranty, with
respect to any and all Haas products, shall be limited to repairing or replacing, at the
discretion of the Manufacturer, the defective Haas product.
Disclaimer of Warranty
This warranty is Manufacturer’s sole and exclusive warranty, and is in lieu of all other
warranties of whatever kind or nature, express or implied, written or oral, including, but not
limited 
to, any 
implied warranty of merchantability, implied warranty of fitness for 
a
particular purpose, or other warranty of quality or performance or noninfringement. All such
other warranties of whatever kind are hereby disclaimed by Manufacturer and waived by
Customer.
iv
Limits and Exclusions of Warranty
Components subject to wear during normal use and over time, including, but not limited to,
paint, window finish and condition, light bulbs, seals, wipers, gaskets, chip removal system
(e.g., augers, chip chutes), belts, filters, door rollers, tool changer fingers, etc., are excluded
from this warranty. Manufacturer’s specified maintenance procedures must be adhered to
and recorded in order to maintain this warranty. This warranty is void if Manufacturer
determines that (i) any Haas Product was subjected to mishandling, misuse, abuse,
neglect, 
accident, 
improper 
installation, 
improper 
maintenance, 
improper 
storage, 
or
improper operation or application, including the use of improper coolants or other fluids, (ii)
any Haas Product was improperly repaired or serviced by Customer, an unauthorized
service technician, or other unauthorized person, (iii) Customer or any person makes or
attempts 
to 
make 
any 
modification 
to 
any 
Haas 
Product 
without 
the 
prior 
written
authorization 
of 
Manufacturer, 
and/or 
(iv) 
any 
Haas 
Product 
was 
used 
for 
any
non-commercial use (such as personal or household use). This warranty does not cover
damage or defect due to an external influence or matters beyond the reasonable control of
Manufacturer, including, but not limited to, theft, vandalism, fire, weather condition (such as
rain, flood, wind, lightning, or earthquake), or acts of war or terrorism.
Without limiting the generality of any of the exclusions or limitations described in this
Certificate, this warranty does not include any warranty that any Haas Product will meet any
person’s production specifications or other requirements, or that operation of any Haas
Product will be uninterrupted or error-free. Manufacturer assumes no responsibility with
respect to the use of any Haas Product by any person, and Manufacturer shall not incur
any liability to any person for any failure in design, production, operation, performance, or
otherwise of any Haas Product, other than repair or replacement of same as set forth in the
warranty above.
Limitation of Liability and Damages
Manufacturer will not be liable to Customer or any other person for any compensatory,
incidental, consequential, punitive, special, or other damage or claim, whether in an action
in contract, tort, or other legal or equitable theory, arising out of or related to any Haas
product, other products or services provided by Manufacturer or an authorized distributor,
service 
technician, 
or 
other 
authorized 
representative 
of 
Manufacturer 
(collectively,
“authorized representative”), or the failure of parts or products made by using any Haas
Product, even if Manufacturer or any authorized representative has been advised of the
possibility of such damages, which damage or claim includes, but is not limited to, loss of
profits, lost data, lost products, loss of revenue, loss of use, cost of down time, business
good will, any damage to equipment, premises, or other property of any person, and any
damage that may be caused by a malfunction of any Haas product. All such damages and
claims are disclaimed by Manufacturer and waived by Customer. Manufacturer’s sole
liability, 
and 
Customer’s 
exclusive 
remedy, 
for 
damages 
and 
claims 
for 
any 
cause
whatsoever shall be limited to repair or replacement, at the discretion of Manufacturer, of
the defective Haas Product as provided in this warranty. 
v
Customer has accepted the limitations and restrictions set forth in this Certificate, including,
but not limited to, the restriction on its right to recover damages, as part of its bargain with
Manufacturer or its Authorized Representative. Customer realizes and acknowledges that
the price of the Haas Products would be higher if Manufacturer were required to be
responsible for damages and claims beyond the scope of this warranty.
Entire Agreement
This Certificate supersedes any and all other agreements, promises, representations, or
warranties, either oral or in writing, between the parties or by Manufacturer with respect to
subject matter of this Certificate, and contains all of the covenants and agreements
between the parties or by Manufacturer with respect to such subject matter. Manufacturer
hereby expressly rejects any other agreements, promises, representations, or warranties,
either oral or in writing, that are in addition to or inconsistent with any term or condition of
this Certificate. No term or condition set forth in this Certificate may be modified or
amended, unless by a written agreement signed by both Manufacturer and Customer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Manufacturer will honor a Warranty Extension only to the
extent that it extends the applicable warranty period.
Transferability
This warranty is transferable from the original Customer to another party if the CNC
Machine is sold via private sale before the end of the warranty period, provided that written
notice thereof is provided to Manufacturer and this warranty is not void at the time of
transfer. The transferee of this warranty will be subject to all terms and conditions of this
Certificate.
Miscellaneous
This warranty shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without application of
rules on conflicts of laws. Any and all disputes arising from this warranty shall be resolved
in a court of competent jurisdiction located in Ventura County, Los Angeles County, or
Orange County, California. Any term or provision of this Certificate that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof, or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.
