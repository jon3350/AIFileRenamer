installation, improper maintenance, improper storage, or improper operation or application, (ii) 
any Haas Product was improperly repaired or serviced by Customer, an unauthorized service

or matters beyond the reasonable control of Manufacturer, including, but not limited to, theft, 
vandalism, fire, weather condition (such as rain, flood, wind, lightning, or earthquake), or acts 
of war or terrorism.
Without limiting the generality of any of the exclusions or limitations described in this Certificate, 
this warranty does not include any warranty that any Haas Product will meet any person’s

for any failure in design, production, operation, performance or otherwise of any Haas Product 
other than repair or replacement of same as set forth in this w
arranty above.
Limitation of Liability and Damages
Manufacturer will not be liable to customer or any other person for any compensatory, incidental,

tort, or other legal or equitable theory, arising out of or related to any haas product, other prod
-
ucts or services provided by manufacturer or an authorized distributor, service technician or 
other authorized representative of manufacturer (collectively, “authorized representative”), or 
the failure of parts or products made by using any haas product, even if manufacturer or any 
authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages, which damage 
or claim includes, but is not limited to, loss of profits, lost data, lost products, loss of revenue, 
loss of use, cost of down time, business good will, any damage to equipment, premises or 
other property of any person, and any damage that may be caused by a malfunction of any

customer. Manufacturer’s sole liability, and customer’s exclusive remedy, for damages and 
claims for any cause whatsoever shall be limited to repair or replacement, at the discretion of 
manufacturer, of the defective haas product as provided in this warranty.  
Customer has accepted the limitations and restrictions set forth in this Certificate, including, 
but not limited to, the restriction on its right to recover damages, as part of its bargain with 
Manufacturer or its Authorized Representative. Customer realizes and acknowledges that the 
price of the Haas Products would be higher if Manufacturer were required to be responsible 
for damages and claims beyond the scope of this warranty.
Entire Agreement
This Certificate supersedes any and all other agreements, promises, representations or war
-
ranties, either oral or in writing, between the parties or by Manufacturer with respect to subject 
matter of this Certificate, and contains all of the covenants and agreements between the parties 
or by Manufacturer with respect to such subject matter.  Manufacturer hereby expressly rejects 
any other agreements, promises, representations or warranties, either oral or in writing, that are

set forth in this Certificate may be modified or amended unless by a written agreement signed 
by both Manufacturer and Customer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Manufacturer will honor 
a Warranty Extension only to the extent that it extends the applicable warranty period.

IMPORTANT! 
 Warranty card should be filled out prior to 
operation.
When using Servo 5C Indexers, Haas Automation recommends us-
ing LIVE CENTERS ONLY!
Tailstocks cannot be used with the HRT320FB table.
P
REPARATION
Clean bottom surface of tailstock casting before mounting to mi
ll table. If there 
are any noticeable burrs or nicks on the mounting surface, clea
n them with a 
deburring stone.

 A
LIGNMENT
1. Mount the supplied 0.625 dia. locating pins to bottom of tai
lstock using 
1/4-
20 x 1/2” socket head cap screw (SHCS).
2. Mount tailstock to clean mill table.
3. Fasten lightly to mill table using 
1/2-13 hex head bolt (HHB), hardened 
tooling washers
 and 
1/2-13 T-Nuts.
4. Extend the tailstock spindle from the body. Use the spindle surface to sweep 
the spindle center line to rotary product center line, align to
 within 0.003 TIR. 
Once the unit is properly aligned, torque the 1/2-13 nuts to 50
 ft-lb.

1. Inspect and clean tailstock taper and tapered surface of li

2. Apply a light coat of oil on the center, before inserting into the spindle. This 
aids in removing the center and also prevents corrosion buildup

Live or dead centers:
 Retract the spindle into the body and the leadscrew will 
force the center out.

Live centers: 
Wedge an aluminum bar between the face of the spindle and the 
rear surface of the live centers’ flange.
Dead centers: 
Thread dead centers are recommended (often called N/C Dead 
Centers). Use a wrench to hold the center in place and turn the
 nut until it 
backs the center out from the spindle.

PERATION
1. The tailstock should be positioned so that after approximately 1” of spindle 
travel, the center comes into contact with the work piece/fixtur
e. If the tailstock 
needs to be repositioned, repeat Step 4 of Tailstock Alignment.
2. Once in contact, apply only enough force on the handwheel to
 hold the work-
piece/fixture securely. 
NOTE:
The force required on the hand wheel is similar 
to the force used in closing a typical garden fau
-
cet.
3. Tighten the spindle lock at this time.

2. Use of the spindle lock is optional when using pneumatic tai
lstock models. 
Use the following information to determine tailstock air pressu
re:
• 
Rotary Tables: Normal operating range 10-60 psi (.7-4.1 bar), Max: 100 
psi (7bar)
• 
Servo 5c indexers*: Normal operation range 5-40 psi. (.3-2.7 bar) Max: 
60 psi. (4.1 bar) Live Centers Only!
•
 Maximum Air pressure = 150 psi (10.3 bar) results in 450 lbs (204kg) 
tailstock force.
• 
Minimum Air pressure = 5 psi (.3 bar) results in 15 lbs (6.8kg) tail-
stock force.
NOTE:
Excessive tailstock force and misalignment greater 
than 0.003 tir will cause premature wear on the 
geartrain and motor.
